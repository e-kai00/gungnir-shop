## Concept

### Business Model
Gungnir Shop is a customer-centric (B2C) e-commerce  venture that sells unique handcrafted jewelry. By bringing unique creations online, the business connects with a global audience that appreciates the artistry and dedication behind each piece.

### Core Business Intents:
- Offer unique handmade jewelry -  presents a curated collection of handmade jewelry that exemplify artistry and originality.

- Showcase the artist's craftsmanship - highlighs the artisan's craftsmanship. Every piece of the collection showcases the artist's meticulous attention to detail, allowing customers to appreciate the journey from concept to creation.

- Provide exceptional customer experience - offers customers an exceptional online shopping experience. The website features intuitive navigation, comprehensive product details, vibrant imagery, and a hassle-free checkout process.

### Marketing Strategies:

To assist with business promotion the following strategies have been put in place:

- Facebook Page linked to the site. It can serve as an online gallery of jewelry creations. Regular posts featuring high-quality images, behind-the-scenes glimpses into the creative process, customesrs review will help to foster a community that shares a passion for artisanal jewelry.

- Newsletter subscription (via Mailchimp). Customers have the opportunity to subscribe to the newsletter, which allows them to gain exclusive access to new jewelry releases and upcoming promotions. This subscription-based communication will help to deepen the connection with the audience.

- Discounts and special offers. The online-shop is equipped to accept coupon codes. Periodic discounts and special offers, announced via social networks, newsletters or in the website's announcements section will help to gain new customers and encourage repeat purchases.


### SEO

The website's SEO strategy focuses on maximizing visibility and accessibility:

- Keyword strategy: a combination of short-tail and long-tail keywords specific to this business were chosen and integrated into meta tags. 
I also made sure that images have clear names and alt tags to help everyone see and understand them better.

- Semantic HTML: the website content is organized with appropriate tags, adhering to best practices. I limited the use of `<h>` tags solely to hierarchical structure rather than stylistic purposes. In instances where the `<section>` tag was used, I linked it via aria-labeledby or area-labeled (aligning with the guidelines of [W3C(WAI)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/landmark-regions/)).

- Technical foundations: robots.txt and sitemap.xml files are included into the project to guide search engine crawlers and contribute to the proper indexing of the website's content.


## UX Design

I aimed to create a clean and simple design for the Gungnir Shop project, focusing on making the website easy to use. The interface has a simple layout with easy-to-understand navigation, so users can manage their shopping easily. The design is kept simple to prevent things from getting too crowded and to avoid any unnecessary distractions.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme for this project is designed to be crisp and fresh.<br>

Background is a clean white, providing a canvas of clarity.<br>
*#80020* - a rich burgundy, used as a main color to contrast the background.<br>
*#222222* - a deep grey represents essential text, ensuring effortless readability.<br>
*#f6f6e1* - a delicate beige hue serves to elegantly contrast text on darker backgrounds.<br>

### Typography

Three [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) were used for the website:

- Yuji Boku - used for logo 
- Montserrat - used as default
- Ysabeau Infant - used for secondary font

### Icons

- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon library is used to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the website.


### Wireframes

I began with initial sketches on paper, which then transfer into wireframes for both desktop and mobile layouts using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) mockup tool. You'll find all wireframes located within the [wireframes](/README_docs/wireframes/) folder for this project.
